            <h3>Leaf tailed gecko</h3>
            <p>The leaf-tailed gecko (also known as the flat-tailed gecko) is a group of geckos that are found only on the African island of Madagascar and on a number of the little islands that surround it. There are eight different species of leaf-tailed gecko all of which are endemic to the island.</p>
            <p>Leaf-tailed geckos are found in both the primary and secondary tropical forests of Madagascar where they are either found stuck vertically to the tree trunks or resting amongst the twigs, depending on the species. All species of leaf-tailed gecko are being threatened by habitat loss caused by drastic deforestation across the island.</p>

            <h3>Leopard Gecko (Eublepharis)</h3>
            <p>A popular beginner's reptile, the leopard gecko comes in a variety of colors and is an easily handled, small lizard.</p>
            <p>Leopard geckos are commonly yellow, white, and spotted with black dots. Hatchlings start out more striped and gradually change to the spotted appearance. There are several color and pattern variations called morphs, which include almost every color of the rainbow.</p>
            <p>Certain colors are more desired and valuable while the common wild-type or normal coloration is readily available and very affordable.</p>
            <h4>Leopard Gecko Behavior and Temperament</h4>
            <p>Leopard geckos are nocturnal, ground-dwelling geckos that are generally docile and easy to tame. They do not have the sticky toe pads like other geckos, so they do not climb walls, but unlike other geckos, they do have eyelids.</p>
            <p>Leopard geckos are not prone to biting and are usually slow-moving. They have perky personalities and are known to be very vocal, especially when they are hungry.</p>

            <h3>Tokay gecko</h3>
            <p>Tokay geckos aren't as commonly seen as pets as leopard geckos, but they are just as interesting as their cousins. They are the second-largest kind of gecko and are known for their vibrant colors and spots. They are usually a blue-gray color with bright orange and blue spots.</p>
            <p>Tokay geckos are vocal, making a unique croaking or barking noise to attract mates, are arboreal, and according to some myths, are said to bring good luck.</p>
            <p>Kept as pets in homes around the world, many Asian cultures also consider tokay geckos to be good luck charms. These lizards are unfortunately frequent targets of poachers in the wild since tokay geckos are used in some medicinal remedies. </p>

            <h3>Cat Gecko</h3>
            <p>Aeluroscalabotes felinus got his common name because of its habit of curling up with its tail around itself when it sleeps, similar to a cat. The cat gecko is a lightly built gecko, typically red-brown in color with white spots on its body, and solid white under its chin, and sometimes to the belly.</p>
            <p>Unlike most arboreal geckos Aeluroscalabotes felinus does not have toe pads (setae) which allow it to climb sheer surfaces. It instead relies on small retractile claws, and a prehensile tail.</p>

            <h3>Day Gecko (Phelsuma)</h3>
            <p>Day geckos belong to the genus Phelsuma and family Gekkonidae. Day geckos are actually a common name of a group of over 60 species of small lizards that vary in size, appearance, and behaviors.</p>
            <p>Popular pet day geckos include the giant day gecko that is recorded to live up to 20 years but more commonly lives six to eight years in captivity.</p>
            <p>Unlike many other lizards, day geckos are active during the daytime. They are generally pretty fragile and it is not a good idea to handle them since their skin is quite delicate. They also can be somewhat territorial and should be housed alone. Males are especially territorial but even mated pairs may fight and need to be separated.</p>
