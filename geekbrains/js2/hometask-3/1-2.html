  <h1>BRAVE NEW WORLD</h1>
  <h2>Chapter One</h2>
  <div id="changeQuotes">
    <p class='test'>A SQUAT grey building of only thirty-four stories. Over
    the main entrance the words, CENTRAL LONDON HATCHERY AND CONDITIONING CENTRE,
    and, in a shield, the World State's motto, COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, STABILITY.</p>
    <p>The enormous room on the ground floor faced towards the north. Cold for
    all the summer beyond the panes, for all the tropical heat of the room itself,
    a harsh thin light glared through the windows, hungrily seeking some draped
    lay figure, some pallid shape of academic goose-flesh, but finding only the
    glass and nickel and bleakly shining porcelain of a laboratory. Wintriness
    responded to wintriness. The overalls of the workers were white, their hands
    gloved with a pale corpse-coloured rubber. The light was frozen, dead, a
    ghost. Only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain
    rich and living substance, lying along the polished tubes like butter, streak
    after luscious streak in long recession down the work tables.</p>
    <p>'And this,' said the Director opening the door, 'is the Fertilizing Room.'</p>
    <p>Bent over their instruments, three hundred Fertilizers were plunged, as
    the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning entered the room, in the scarcely
    breathing silence, the absent-minded, soliloquizing hum or whistle, of
    absorbed concentration. A troop of newly arrived students, very young, pink
    and callow, followed nervously, rather abjectly, at the Director's heels. Each
    of them carried a notebook, in which, whenever the great man spoke, he
    desperately scribbled. Straight from the horse's mouth. It was a rare
    privilege. The D. H. C. for Central London always made a point of personally
    conducting his new students round the various departments.</p>
    <p>'Just to give you a general idea,' he would explain to them. For of course
    some sort of general idea they must have, if they were to do their work
    intelligently–though as little of one, if they were to be good and happy
    members of society, as possible. For particulars, as every one knows, make for
    virtue and happiness; generalities are intellectually necessary evils. Not
    philosophers but fret-sawyers and stamp collectors compose the backbone of
    society.</p>
    <p>'To-morrow,' he would add, smiling at them with a slightly menacing
    geniality, 'you'll be settling down to serious work. You won't have time for
    generalities. Meanwhile …'</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, it was a privilege. Straight from the horse's mouth into the
    notebook. The boys scribbled like mad.</p>
